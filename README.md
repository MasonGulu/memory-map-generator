Disclaimer, the code was written a year ago. I did not have any sense of an education in programming at the time, and my education now is still pretty limited. At some point I may remake this from scratch, or if I feel adventerous I may refactor this. Regardless of what I do, in the meantime this code will hurt you if you try to read it.
